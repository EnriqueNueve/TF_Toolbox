# TF_Toolbox
An organized repo for all things TensorFlow: tutorials, data, and models. 

## Steps to implement a model
---
1. Implement custom functions.
2. Implement custom layers to store custom functions, if possible.
3. Implement custom model that joins custom functions and layers.
4. Test pass of random data and check dimensionality. 
5. Train model on one piece of data and make sure it learns.
6. Test on all training data.
